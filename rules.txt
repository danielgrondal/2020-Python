General:

Each city you develop will be assessed on three qualities:
- How many people you manage to house
- How happy your inhabitants are with your work
- How environmentally friendly you are

Each city can be attempted as many times as you like and the best score for each city will be counted. 
The sum of the scores for each city will then be used as your final score. 

Playing:

1. Each game session begins with calling /new to create a new game, 
    in return you will get information about your game session and the map on which it will be played. 
2. to start the game, call /start to receive the first game state. 
3. Decide what you want to do and call one of the /action/ endpoints to perform an action on the game state 
    and progress the game one turn. Each call to /action/ returns an updated game state. 
4. Each game lasts for 700 turns

Score:

To view your score, call the route /getScore or go to the Highscore page to view each teams best score. 
If you want to view the replay, call /replay or view the replay by going to the Visualizer and pasting your game id. 
Each team can have a maximum of 4 games active at the same time.

Map:

Each map differs on some important characteristics. 
- the layout and available buildable space will be different
- the climate with different Max Temperature and Min Temperature. 
- The types of Available Buildings will also differ per map
- on some maps some buildings might already be constructed when the map starts. 
- The types of available energy will be the same for all maps with the same cost and co2 emissions, 
  but the amount of energy available for each type will differ. 
  - Your starting Funds and the number of people in Queue can also be different. 

It is important to change your strategy depending on which map you are playing 
since some strategies can work better on some maps.

Builds:

- residence (apartments, cabin, ...)
- utilities (park, mall, ...)
  * Place them in positions with lots of other buildings nearby to maximize their usefulness.
- upgrades
  * The upgrades enhance the residence in which they are built. 
- effects
  * The effects are applied by either a utility building or by an upgrade.
- Energy, Temperature and Maintenance
  *  /action/adjustEnergy, (150 funds) to change the residences Requested Energy
  *  Any energy bought above the Base Energy Need will be converted to heat.  This can be used to control 
     the temperature of the residence when the outdoor temperature changes during the game
  * 183 turns make up a year during which the temperature will rise and fall.
  * Each map will have three tiers of energy that can be purchased.
  * The indoor temperature should be as close to 21 degrees as possible
    - newTemp = indoorTemp + (effectiveEnergyIn - baseEnergyNeed) * degreesPerExcessMwh + degreesPerPop * currentPop - (indoorTemp - outdoorTemp) * emissivity
  * Maintenance is required to keep the health of a building high. 
- queue and population
  * the inhabitants will first enter a queue
  * As long as they do not stand in a Long Queue for more than a certain Queue Tick Threshold turns they will 
    be happy and contribute to your overall happiness score, up to the Queue Max Happiness each turn
  * Each building has their own inhabitants which generate income and happiness depending on the building they live in. 
    They also contribute a fixed Co2 per Pop every tick. 
    Low Happiness in a building => the inhabitants will start to move out => bad effects on your economy and your scores
- population, happiness, co2 and score
  * Population is calculated only at the end of each session
  * Happiness is cumulative over the entire game session. 
    - keep inhabitants happy by having a good indoor temperature and a well maintained building
    - keep the queue happy by letting everyone that enters the queue move into your district.
  * The final score is calculated as: score = population*15 + happiness/10 - co2
